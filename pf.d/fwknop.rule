# fwknop only requires an anchor, strictly speaking no rules may be required

# The following lines are disabled by default
# A better policy is to log all blocked incoming traffic
# If for some reason you don't wish to log all ports you can log specific ports/ranges with the macro and rule below
# Note that if your values for listen_ports conflict with an open port it may override open ports depending on where the anchor is

#listen_ports = "{ 62201 }"                        # Knocking port(s) to listen in on
#block in drop log proto udp to port $listen_ports # Don't respond to the knock port and log requests from the knock port(s)
